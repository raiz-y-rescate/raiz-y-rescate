  <h3>My Story</h3>

  <p>
    I work inside the construction world. Every so often I review projects that are labeled as “wins”;
    offices, healthcare facilities, secure storage, expansions meant to last decades. And yet, quietly,
    I've noticed which buildings will crumble, and which will reamin and expand.
  </p>

  <p>
    These old world projects do not lack skill or intelligence; actually, the architecture/designs are beautiful 
    and futuristic, but because many of them are still being designed for a reality that is already shifting.
    They rely on assumptions of permanence, centralization, and systems that must remain perfectly intact to function.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, I began noticing a contrast. A few projects hinted at a different way of thinking,
    designs that consider airflow instead of brute-force cooling, adaptability instead of rigidity,
    and human presence as something to support rather than manage.
  </p>

  <p>
    This section exists to explore that divide: what remains, what changes, and why. Some innovators are
    quietly preparing for what lies ahead, while others continue reinforcing systems that may soon be
    left behind. Here, I map those patterns, not to judge, but to understand, and to offer clarity to
    those who sense the transition but don’t yet have language for it.
  </p>

</section>

      <section class="card">

  <h3>Why Patterns Matter</h3>

  <p>
    Before we move into what remains, what changes, and what we rebuild, it helps to pause and ask a
    quieter question: <em>why is this happening at all?</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    To understand that, we have to look at patterns, not trends, not predictions, but patterns that
    have existed long before time was formally tracked. From the earliest cells to the first creatures,
    to early humans who observed the seasons. Life has always moved in cycles.
  </p>

  <p>
    At some point, humanity stopped simply <em>living within</em> these patterns and began trying to
    dominate or escape them. Whether we are now approaching a moment of breaking free, or simply
    entering another turn of the cycle —is still unfolding. But to even recognize the shape of the
    pattern, we need a map.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most practical modern lenses for this comes from the book
    <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong>
    by William Strauss and Neil Howe. It describes recurring generational cycles, four “turnings” that
    repeat across history, not in a straight line, but in a loop.
  </p>

  <p>
    These turnings move through periods of stability, awakening, unraveling, and finally crisis;
    before the cycle begins again. What’s important is that these patterns are not confined to one
    country or culture; they appear across civilizations, shaped by different events but following a
    familiar rhythm.
  </p>

  <p>
    A similar pattern-focused approach can be seen in the work of
    <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</strong>, particularly in
    <em>:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</em>,
    where long-term debt cycles, empires, and power shifts are mapped visually. These are not guesses,
    they are patterns observed over centuries.
  </p>

  <!-- Optional future visual placeholder -->
  <!-- <p><em>[Future: Add a simple visual map or graph illustrating these cycles]</em></p> -->

  <p>
    What’s striking is that this way of seeing the world isn’t new. It’s ancient.
  </p>

  <p>
    My parents were raised on one of the smallest ranches near El Rosario, Sinaloa, Mexico. They grew up
    with a kind of knowledge that didn’t come from books. My grandfather would cut trees only during a
    certain phase of the moon — because during that cycle, the wood would last longer. My other
    grandfather could anticipate when a cow was about to give birth simply by observing the moon.
  </p>

  <p>
    This kind of knowing was once widespread. Sap rises toward a plant’s leaves during the full moon,
    and during the waning phases, energy returns to the roots. These patterns guided planting, building,
    harvesting, and care. Much of this wisdom has been forgotten, though traces of it remain, something
    we’ll explore more deeply in the <em>Land &amp; Water</em> section.
  </p>

  <!-- Optional future link placeholder -->
  <!-- <p><em>[Future: Link to Land & Water — lunar and seasonal patterns]</em></p> -->

  <p>
    Long before modern calendars, Indigenous civilizations were already tracking time through cycles.
    The Maya, for example, organized time using baktuns —long arcs of roughly 400 years. When one baktun
    ended in December 2012, it wasn’t the end of the world, but the completion of a cycle. A new “sun”
    began. The shift was subtle, quiet, and deeply symbolic.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Mayan calendar wasn’t abstract. It was practical; used for planting, ceremonies, governance,
    and community rhythm. Similar pattern-based systems existed across Indigenous cultures worldwide,
    each tuned to land, sky, and season.
  </p>

  <p>
    This section exists to hold these perspectives together: modern frameworks, ancestral knowledge,
    and lived observation. Not to romanticize the past or predict the future, but to recognize the
    patterns that continue to move beneath it all.
  </p>

        <p>
  So why does all of this matter? Because once we begin to recognize patterns, we gain a clearer sense
  of what comes next, what begins to crumble, what quietly remains, and what will need to be rebuilt.
  History may not repeat itself exactly, but it often rhymes.
</p>

<p>
  Are we approaching the climax of a Fourth Turning, or already standing within it? Is this what
  some call a “new world order,” or something more subtle, more human? What does seem to be present
  already is the sense of a new beginning, a new sun rising, not through collapse alone, but through
  awareness.
</p>

<p>
  A Mayan elder known as Wandering Wolf once said: <em>“Wake up. If you are sleeping, wake up. If you are
  resting, walk. It is the hour of the dawn. The work is ending. Get up. Everyone get up. Let no one be
  left behind. We will continue the path, and we will see again the city from where we have come.”</em>
