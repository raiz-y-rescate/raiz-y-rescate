  How we build reveals what we believe will last.
</p>

<p class="lede">
  I work inside the construction world, and lately I’ve been noticing something quietly striking:
  many new projects are still designed for a reality that is already fading.
</p>

<section class="card">
  <h3>What I’m seeing from the inside</h3>
  <p>
    I’ll read through a list of “wins” — office tenant improvements, federal ammunition storage,
    healthcare expansions, and I can’t help but feel the contrast. Not because those buildings aren’t
    impressive, but because so many of them depend on the same brittle assumptions:
    endless energy, endless complexity, and systems that must stay perfectly centralized to function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every once in a while, a project hints at what’s coming; a data center designed to cool with wind
    instead of water, or a research laboratory built for acoustics and precision. Those kinds of efforts
    feel closer to the next chapter. Still, even many “advanced” builds carry an old-world blueprint.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page exists to explore what we rebuild when the goal is not just efficiency, but resilience:
    structures that breathe, hold steady through heat and cold, invite light, support health, and can be
    repaired by humans, not only by supply chains.
  </p>

      <p>
  Over time, this section will expand into ideas like <strong>Old World / New World</strong>,
  <strong>Architecture & Engineering</strong>, and practical building methods rooted in nature and history.
