        <p><em>Why it matters:</em>
          Awareness of self, body, and breath is the foundation for emotional safety,
          empathy, and regulation. This is where children learn to notice without shame.
        </p>

        <p><em>Notes:</em>
          Gentle language. No correction. Slow pacing. Model breathing.

            <p>Our Healing · The Beginning</p>

            <p>
              You and I are going to use adult language here. Language that may feel uncomfortable,
              heavy, or difficult to fully digest at first. And that discomfort is exactly why this matters,
              because we were never meant to carry what so many of us carry quietly into adulthood.
            </p>

            <p>This curriculum exists because something went missing early on.</p>

            <p>
              Many of us grew up learning how to perform, behave, and comply — but not how to feel,
              name, or safely process what was happening inside our own bodies. We learned to dismiss
              discomfort, to move on quickly, to stay quiet, to feel shame around things we didn’t yet
              have language for.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were corrected instead of guided.<br>
              Silenced instead of supported.
            </p>

            <p>
              And so confusion became internalized.<br>
              Curiosity became something to hide.<br>
              Fear learned to wear armor.
            </p>

            <p>I know this not as theory, but as lived experience.</p>

            <p>
              Like many children, I experienced moments early in life that were confusing, unspoken,
              and left without guidance. Nothing malicious. Nothing dramatic. Just moments that needed
              explanation, care, and safety — and instead were met with silence.
            </p>

            <p>
              I did not lack empathy. I lacked language.
              I lacked adults who knew how to sit with those moments and translate them gently.
            </p>

            <p>And that is where things begin to fracture.</p>

            <p>
              When a child is not taught how to understand their own body, breath, emotions,
              and internal signals, they don’t disappear — they get buried.
            </p>

            <p>
              Later, they resurface as anxiety, rigidity, pride, fear, disconnection,
              or pain we can’t quite name.
            </p>

            <p>This is why Group One matters so deeply.</p>

            <p>
              This is not emotional intelligence training.<br>
              This is not self-improvement.<br>
              This is repair at the root.
            </p>

            <p>
              Awareness of self, body, and breath is where empathy begins.
              It is where shame is prevented before it forms.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is where children learn:<br>
              “I can feel something without being wrong.”<br>
              “I can be curious without being unsafe.”<br>
              “I can pause, breathe, and stay connected to myself.”
            </p>

            <p>
              If we had been taught this early — gently, honestly, without punishment or silence —
              many of the quiet traumas we see today would never have needed to harden inside us.
            </p>

            <p>
              This curriculum is for the builders of what comes next.
              For those who understand that healing does not begin with fixing the world —
              it begins with helping children feel at home in themselves.
            </p>

            <p><strong>This is where it starts.</strong></p>

            <p>
              <em>From me to you:</em><br>
              Every time you say:<br>
              “This feeling can be named”<br>
              “This confusion can be held”<br>
              “This moment doesn’t need shame”
            </p>

            <p>…a younger version of you hears it too.</p>

        <h2>First Lesson Sample</h2>
        <p class="intro-line">
          This is the foundation: awareness of self, body, and breath. If children learn nothing else first,
          let it be this: the ability to notice and return.
        </p>

        <h3>Lesson Title</h3>
        <p><strong>“I Can Feel My Body”, a gentle awareness practice</strong></p>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Help children recognize sensations in the body, practice a calm breath rhythm, and learn that they
          can return to safety inside themselves.
        </p>

        <h3>Time</h3>
        <p>5–10 minutes</p>

        <h3>Materials</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>None (optional: a small stone, leaf, or soft object to hold)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Teacher Script (starter)</h3>
        <p>
          “Let’s sit like a mountain, comfortable and steady.  
          Can you feel your feet? Can you feel your hands?  
          Now place one hand on your heart or belly.  
          Let’s take three slow breaths together… in… and out…”
        </p>

        <h3>Optional Add-Ons</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Notice 3 sounds you can hear</li>
          <li>Notice 3 colors you can see</li>
          <li>Hold a “quiet object” and describe its texture</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Closing Line</h3>
        <p>
          “Anytime you feel big feelings, you can come back here — to your breath, to your body, to your center.”
        </p>

        <p class="lede">
          Next: Add a simple outdoor activity (barefoot on grass, listening walk, seed planting) to anchor the lesson in nature.
